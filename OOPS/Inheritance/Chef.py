##Inheritance
##we can define a bunch of attributes and fucntions and things inside of a
##class and then we create another class and we can inherit all of those attributes.





class Chef:

    def make_sandwich(self):
        print("The chef makes a sandwich")

    def make_salad(self):
        print("The chef makes a salad")

    def make_special_dish(self):
        print("The chef makes burgers")
