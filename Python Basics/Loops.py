###Loops
'''Iteration means executing the same block of code over and over, potentially many times.
A programming structure that implements iteration is called a loop.'''

##while loop(Indefinite Iteration)

'''It is basically a structure in python which allows us to loop through and executing block of code multiple times repeatedly until a certain condition was false.
With indefinite iteration, the number of times the loop is executed isnâ€™t specified explicitly in advance. Rather, the designated block is
executed repeatedly as long as some condition is met.'''
 
##Example
i = 1
while i <=10:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1

print("Done with loop\n")


###for loop(Definite iteration)
'''With definite iteration, the number of times the designated block will be executed is specified explicitly at the time the loop starts.
It is a special type of loop which allows to loop over different collection and items. It loops through series of numbers.'''

##Example 1

for letter in "Giraffe Academy":
    print(letter)


    
#Example 2

friends = ["Jim","Karen","Kevin"]
for friend in friends:
    print(friend)

friends = ["Jim","Karen","Kevin"]
for index in range(3,10):
    print(index)


##Exponent Function:
#It allows to take a certain number and raise it to a specific power.
def raise_to_power(base_num,pow_num):
    result = 1
    for index in range(pow_num):
        result = result * base_num
    return result

print(raise_to_power(3,4))


###Nested for loop:
##For loop inside for loop

number_grid = [
    [1,2,3],
    [4,5,6],
    [7,8,9],
    [0]
]

for row in number_grid:
    for col in row:
        print(col)
    print(row)
