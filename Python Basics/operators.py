###Operators

#Operators are the special symbols in python that we use to perform operations on values and variables.It carries out arithmetic or logical computation.

##1.Assignment operator
##2.Arithmetic operators
##3.Comparison operators
##4.Logical operators
##5.Bitwise operators

#1.Assignment operator
age = 8
new_age = age
print(new_age)

#2.Arithmetic operator

print(1 + 1)
print(2 - 1)
print(2 * 2) 
print(4 / 2) 
print(4 % 3) 
print(4 ** 2) 
print(4 //  2)

#3.Comparison operator
a = 1
b = 2

print(a == b)
print(a != b) 
print(a > b)
print(a <= b) 

#4.Logical operator
condition1 = True
condition2 = False

print(not condition1) 
print(condition1 and condition2) 
print(condition1 or condition2)

#5.Bitwise operators
#is called the identity operator. It is used to compare two objects and returns true if both are the same object.
#in is called the membership operator. Is used to tell if a value is contained in a list, or another sequence.
